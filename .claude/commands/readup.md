# Restart Command

Resume work on this repository by gathering context and understanding where we left off.

## 1. Read Context Files

- Read `CLAUDE.md` for project guidance
- Read all `*-design.md` files to understand previous algorithmic decisions
- Read any other `.md` files in the root directory

## 2. Check for Uncommitted Work

- Run `git status` to see any uncommitted changes
- Run `git diff` to see what's been modified
- If there are uncommitted changes, read those files to understand work in progress
- look for the new puzzle and extract the sample input into an appropriately named file. create another empty file for the final input, if it's not there already.

## 3. Ask the User 3 Questions

look to see if there's a new day to start working on, or prompt the user if puzzle.txt isn't modified in the next day
