# Restart Command

Resume work on this repository by gathering context and understanding where we left off.

## 1. Read Context Files
- Read `CLAUDE.md` for project guidance
- Read all `*-design.md` files to understand previous algorithmic decisions
- Read any other `.md` files in the root directory

## 2. Check for Uncommitted Work
- Run `git status` to see any uncommitted changes
- Run `git diff` to see what's been modified
- If there are uncommitted changes, read those files to understand work in progress

## 3. Ask the User 3 Questions
After gathering context, ask the user:

1. **Continue or new?** - Are we continuing previous work or starting something new (e.g., a new day's puzzle)?
2. **Current goal** - What's the main thing you want to accomplish this session?
3. **Any blockers?** - Is there anything you were stuck on or want to approach differently?

Then proceed based on their answers, following the Solution Design Process from CLAUDE.md.
